// <!--First thought is to create 3 arrays, one for letters, one for numbers, and one for special characters. We will be able to pull from these arrays when we need to generate the password -->
// Crucial elements: Password length (user choice) - so we will need to loop and choose (based on preferences, else ifs or functions) 

var letters = [A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z] 
var numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
var spechar = ["~","!","@","#","$","%","^","*","(",")","-","_","+","="]
var userPwLength = prompt("How many characters do you want your password? Please use whole numbers?")
var userSpecChar = confirm("Do you want special characters?")
var userCapLetter = confirm("Do you want capital letters?")
var userLowerLetter = confirm("Do you want lower case letters?")
var userNumber = confirm("Do you want to use numbers?")
//  Above can be polished ^ can we do something with properties? User and the properties will be
// Spec Char boolean answer Number boolean answer etc.
//  We can take the approach above - or we can set a condition that makes it alert if an integer is not input. Where it prompts them right away. Instead of after the fact.


//                                                                        IDEAS FOR USER INPUT AND LOOPS
// The loop will depend on how many characters the user selects. So userselection will be the variable in the loop: 
// (var i = 0; i < userSelection.length; i++) We want to say "As long as the number of returned characters in the PW is less than the number the user selected
// we want to run through the random generator.
// CREATE A USER INPUT VARIABLE AND USE LENGTH to Get Length. Then use this value in your looping. "Is number integer? If not prompt user to enter whole number / Integer"
// So KEEP LOOPING THIS UNTIL WE HIT USER INPUT LENGTH 



// Conditions if they choose 12 characters, and True for every question.
            //Length of userselection: 12 Pick up to 12 RANDOM letters numbers and characters .
 
// The user choicees will be:
                    // How many total characters? Do we give them a limit? 8, 12, 16, 18? or do we want to give them unlimited? Type out how many characters?                     
                                        // Do you want special characters? Y N
                                        // //                     
                                        // Do you want any numbers? Y N/
                                        // //                    
                                        //  Do you want capital letterS? Y N 
                                        // //                     
                                        // Do you want lower case characters? Y N 
                                        // //                   
                                        //   Answers to all except for first question will be T / F 

// How we will generate the password: Generate a random number (math random math floor and integer if needed to pick index between length of each respective array) 
// from each array to the length of the persons vhoice. Use a loop here to keep grabbing numbers and letter setc. So if their choice is 5
// characters we want it to loop until 5 characters are pulled. 




// Prompt User: Do you want special characters? Click confirm if so, click cancel if not. 
// Prompt User: Do you want numbers? Click confirm if so, click cancel if not

<script type="text/javascript">
var letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y","Z"]
var numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

UserPwLength = prompt("How long do you want your password to be?")    
console.log(UserPwLength)
// Now we need to make this randomly choose the index - and we want it to choose randomly between letters and numbers equally but we will fix that up later.

// So we can do mathrandom for both arrays (if applicable): and math random choose index in array

var randomLetter = Math.floor(Math.random() *25)
alert(randomLetter)
console.log(randomLetter)
//  So we are getting a random number between 0 and 24 specifically for the letters array. We can do the same for numbers

var randomNumbers = Math.floor(Math.random() *10) 
console.log(randomNumbers)
alert(randomNumbers)

// I previously was printing the below variable to console but I decided to stop printing it and just create a new variable "ran1" for random number 1. I know this will change and be easier later.
var ran1 = (letters[randomLetter])
var ran2 = (numbers[randomNumbers])
// In order to create a real variable 2 below (for a second random number) I need to loop the above generation of random numbers a second time to create the second random variable.


alert("User Password Generated: " + "Random Number: " + ran1 + ran2)

// I've gotten results of U2 and C7 so I know the above statements for var ran1 and ran2 are working!
